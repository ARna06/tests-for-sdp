# tests-for-sdp

This is the repository containing test results for which are directed to be performed as a part of the project Randomized Solver for Semidefinite Programs.

## Usage

Navigate to `test` folders to see the corresponding results.

## Test-1

Compile and run `volesti`. Use the R extension to visualize sampling (with any sampling algorithm) in a polytope.

*Status* : Done

## Test-2

Extend the hit-and-run algorithm to sample from the boundary of the spectrahedron (feasible region of an SDP).

*Status* : Done

## Test-3

Implement an interior point algorithm for linear programming.

*Status* : Paritally done
